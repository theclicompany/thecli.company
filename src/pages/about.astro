  <p>
    The CLI Company is a carefully curated collection of exceptional
    command-line tools designed for developers, system administrators, and power
    users who demand quality and efficiency.
  </p>
  <h3 id="our-mission">Our Mission</h3>
  <p>
    We believe that great command-line tools can transform how you work.
    That&#39;s why we focus on discovering, collecting, and showcasing the
    highest quality CLI utilities available. Every tool in our collection has
    been selected for its reliability, performance, and ability to solve real
    problems elegantly.
  </p>
  <h3 id="open-source-always">Open Source, Always</h3>
  <p>
    All tools featured in our collection are open source. We champion
    transparency, community collaboration, and the freedom to inspect, modify,
    and contribute to the software you use every day. Open source isn&#39;t just
    our preferenceâ€”it&#39;s our principle.
  </p>
  <h3 id="quality-over-quantity">Quality Over Quantity</h3>
  <p>
    Rather than overwhelming you with endless options, we take a thoughtful
    approach to curation. Each CLI tool undergoes careful evaluation for code
    quality, documentation, maintenance status, and real-world utility. Our
    collection grows deliberately, ensuring that every addition meets our high
    standards.
  </p>
  <h3 id="built-for-builders">Built for Builders</h3>
  <p>
    Whether you&#39;re automating workflows, managing infrastructure, processing
    data, or building the next great application, our curated selection provides
    the reliable tools you need to work efficiently and effectively from the
    command line.
