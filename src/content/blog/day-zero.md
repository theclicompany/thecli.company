*June 15, 2025*

Today, The CLI Company was born.

It started with a simple frustration: spending too much time hunting for quality command-line tools across scattered repositories, outdated lists, and half-maintained collections.
Good CLI tools exist—they're just buried under noise.

So here we are.
The idea is straightforward: create a collection of genuinely useful, well-maintained, open source command-line tools.
No bloat. No marketing fluff. Just tools that solve real problems.

We're not trying to reinvent the wheel or build the next big platform.
We're trying to build something good—a place where you can find reliable CLI utilities.

The collection starts small.
Quality over quantity, always.
Each tool will earn its place by being genuinely useful, actively maintained, and built to last.

This is day zero. The work begins now.
